                                <p id="paragraph1"> Daniel Tian is born in Plano, Texas and studied at the University of Texas at Austin in mechanical engineering. He has worked in the MEP (Mechanical, Electrical, and Plumbing) industry for over a year. However, he found his passion in coding
                                    after realizing how much he enjoyed his computer science courses. After taking courses in web development, databases, and software design, he has decided to commit three months at the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp to grow in his skills as a web programmer. </p>
                                    <p id="paragraph2"> Outside of his passion for coding, he enjoys exercising, such as going to the gym and running around Austin. He is also involved in international undergraduate ministry and the elderly care ministry at Gracepoint Austin church and devotes how much free time he has left in reading
                                        the bible.</p>
